# Frontend task


Project Overview:

Technology Used:
I utilized React.js for this project due to its ability to create reusable components, which is heavily leveraged to efficiently render products throughout the application.

Data Management:
I created a dummy dataset containing property details. To manage and access this data, I used React's Context API. This choice was made to avoid prop drilling by providing a centralized storage solution that allows for easier state management across different components.

Routing:
For handling navigation within the app, I implemented react-router-dom along with useParams and useNavigation hooks. This setup facilitates smooth and dynamic routing between different pages of the application.

Login & Signup Feature:
Unfortunately, I was unable to implement the login and signup functionality due to the requirement of backend connectivity, which is not currently part of the project scope.

Data Persistence:
To ensure data persistence across renders, the data is stored in the browser's storage. This allows the application to maintain state even after multiple renders, enhancing user experience.

Design:
While the application functions as expected, the design is not as polished as I would like. Due to time constraints and a focus on core functionality, the UI/UX aspects have not been fully refined. Future iterations will focus on improving the overall design and user interface to make the application more visually appealing.
